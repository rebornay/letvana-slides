# Problem Statement

Despite the existence of rental hubs in the market, renters still experience issues such as unreliable property information, scam, limited transparency around payments and agreements, no centralized digital hub to manage tenant‚Äìlandlord relationships and agent monopoly. 


This project seeks to address these pain points by creating a user-centered rental platform.

# Brand Identity

- Rendered in Satoshi Bold, the name ***‚ÄúLetvana‚Äù*** appears clean and strong. The capital ***L*** gives the name presence, while the rest of the letters maintain a friendly and approachable tone. The unique fusion of Let which means ***"To Let‚Äù*** and Nirvana which means ***‚Äúa state of liberation and freedom from suffering‚Äù*** (which inspired the name) is reflected in the calm authority of the typography. 

**Core Values:**
- Trust: We ensure all listings are verified and secure to build user confidence.
- Simplicity: We create a seamless rental journey from discovery to payment.
- Transparency: No hidden fees or deceptive listings, what you see is what you get.
- Empowerment: We equip tenants and landlords with tools and data to make informed decisions.
- Innovation: We continuously improve through data-driven iterations and customer feedback.

# Business Opportunity

- Listing Fees & Subscriptions: Landlords/agents can pay for featured listings or subscribe for multiple property management tools.
- Payment Service Fee: A small fee (e.g. 2‚Äì5%) on processed rent transactions, similar to Lagos‚Äôs planned 5% digital rent fee.
- Value-Added Services: Revenue share from optional services like rent insurance, tenant screening, furniture rental partnerships.
- Data & Analytics: Sell anonymized rental market insights (price trends, vacancy rates) to developers and local agencies.

<br>

<span>TAM:</span> Lagos (21M people, 98% renting  has 6‚Äì8M households. At an average rent of ‚Ç¶1M/yr, the total Lagos rental market could be ‚Ç¶6‚Äì8 trillion (15‚Äì20B) annually.

# The Market

**User Stories**

## 1. The Tenant's Frustration

<br>

> ‚ÄúI don't want the hassles of multiple agent appointments or dealing with half-truths.  
> I want to search directly for properties.‚Äù

<br>

> ‚ÄúI don't want agents hustling me on charges I'm unsure about.  
> I want the truth directly from the Landlord, minus the fee.‚Äù

<br>

## 2. The Landlord's Burden:

<br>

>"I'm tired of being misrepresented by agents regarding information, payments, and fees."
>"I'm tired of agents inflating fees, creating bottlenecks that stop renters from occupying my property."

<br>

## 3. The Letvana Promise:

- Verify users with ID and phone/email validation.
- Ensure secure payment integration for both parties.

After the retention period, your data is securely deleted.
